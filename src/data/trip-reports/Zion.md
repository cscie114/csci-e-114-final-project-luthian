My brother and I went to Zion National Park as part of a road trip across the Southwest. He had bought a customized van in Alaska that had sleeping space but no water or bathrooms. I met him in San Jose and we stopped at Zion some time in August. Looking back on it, I think the park was closed but there was nothing that stopped us from entering.

We hiked around on the first day, including some fairly difficult terrain, at least for us. Again, in hindsight, I think we were off the trail but there were no markers! On the way, we met a woman who was also hiking the same "trail" we were. We chatted and ended up camping next to each other next to a small stream.

The next morning, it was cold enough that we had to break the ice on the stream to get water to boil for breakfast! Since we didn't have a lot of time, we did some more sightseeing and then left for our next destination.

I ended up writing the woman and we did some corresponding afterward but I've since lost track of her.
