My brother and I went a road trip across the Southwest; I met him in San Jose and flew home from Albqueque. He had bought a customized van in Alaska that had sleeping space but no water or bathrooms. We had been pacing a storm during the trip; we had overtaken it, which meant driving through a lot of rain, and gotten ahead of it before we saw Zion National Park.

Any trip through the Southwest _has_ to include the Grand Canyon and we were headed that way. The North Rim is apparently pretty high up and it was getting colder. The last place we stopped for food and gas said there was a snow storm coming and hinted that they might close the road into the Canyon. It was starting to get dark but we didn't think we'd get another chance so we drove into the park and headed for the rim. Through the trees, I could see bits of some pretty amazing canyon but my brother said, "That's nothing; wait till you see the the real thing!"

We did take a short break to photograph some wildlife alongside the road and during the drive in, I saw some cool scenery through the trees and pointed it out. My brother said, "That's _nothing!_" Eventually, with the light failing, we got to the _actual_ Grand Canyon. It certainly lived up to the hype! I snapped a _lot_ of pictures; at least one roll of film, and then we piled back into the van and drove out.

Sure enough, the storm hit and they closed the road so that was it. The Grand Canyon in under 10 minutes of furious picture-snapping. We did get to the South Rim, where it was much warmer, so I got to see it from another perspective buy hey; it's a good story.

Alas, I can't find a digital copy of those pictures so this is one from the National Park Service.
