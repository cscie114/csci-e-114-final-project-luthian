My brother and I went a road trip across the Southwest; I met him in San Jose and flew home from Albuquerque. He had bought a customized van in Alaska that had sleeping space but no water or bathrooms. One of our first stops was at Joshua Tree National Park and it was very cool.

We had a camping spot on a circle so we could venture out from the van to see the sights and then come back to sleep. There were a group of people from Australia, I think, across the circle and they were rather boisterous, to say the least. They had a nice fire going and the alcohol was flowing. I think we did go over and introduce ourselves but didn't drink or stay long because we wanted an early start.

We spent one day clambering over huge boulders and hiking around. The Joshua Trees themselves were pretty cool, too!

One thing that I definitely remember was a large RV parked in the next circle over. The shades were up and I could see a guy in a recliner watching TV. Here he was, surrounded by amazing scenery and he was...watching TV like he was at home! I just don't get it.

Alas, I can't find a digital copy of any pictures from this trip so this is one from the National Park Service.
